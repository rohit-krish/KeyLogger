# `KEYLOGGER-C`

## C code for windows which peek through almost all keyboard charecters and store it in a seperate file


### the basic.c file will only work if it is focused but it may gonna be a problem when we remove the window while execution


### but advanced.c file will work even without focus to the program


#### HOPE YOU GONNA ENJOY ITðŸ˜ŽðŸ¤©ðŸ’–ðŸ’¥!!
